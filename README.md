## National Corgi Day April 8th, July 1st, October 28th.

Corgi Day' is by our calculation on: April the 20th. However, on theSo Cal Corgi Beach day there are three dates in which hundreds of people and their corgis gather on the beaches of Southern California to "PAWTY". 

The event was first started in October 2012 for corgi lovers to unite and celebrate these adorable little fluff balls.

So Cal Corgi Nation, is a group of Corgi enthusiasts and their low riding canine friends. Led by Mr. Pickles the corgi, the official host of So Cal Corgi Beach Day, they gather 3 times a year- Spring, Summer and Fall, for "So Cal Corgi Beach Day", a free, fun-filled day of corgi meet-and-greets, doggie limbo contests, photo ops, vendors, giveaways, corgi costumes, talent contests, and MORE!

The event, which has drawn national and global media coverage, first began in the Fall of 2012 with just 15 dogs. Their last meet up in October had over 850 corgis in attendance and brought thousands of people from all over the USA- even as far as Japan!  

So Cal Corgi Beach Day has partnered since 2013 with a local corgi and corgi mix rescue, Queen's Best Stumpy Dog Rescue.  Queen's Best, or QBSDR, has helped rescue over 60 dogs since they began in 2013. 
So Cal Corgi Nation is proud to donate a portion of their proceeds to QBSDR, aiding them to continue to "save low riders, one bark at the time!"

This Holiday is not officially acknolwedged by the US Government.

According to [the event website](http://socalcorgibeachday.com/events/) the next Corgi Day is:
